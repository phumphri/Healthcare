    <h1>Healthcare v. Poverty by State</h1>

        <p>
            There is a correlation between the poverty rate and healthcare.  Affluent states with low poverty rates
            like Massachusetts have high rates of healthcare. The coverse is true.  Texas, with a high poverty rate
            also has a high-degree of lacking healthcare.

            Puerto Rico is the outlier.  From "Puerto Rico Health Care Infrastructure Assessment" by University of North Carolina, January 2017:

        <p>
            In 2014, Puerto Rico had a high health insurance coverage rate (94 percent) in comparison to the US mainland (88 percent).
            However, most of the health insurance provided in Puerto Rico was through publically funded insurance programs
            including Puerto Rico’s Medicaid/CHIP program (39 percent), Puerto Rico’s Medicare Advantage (16 percent) and
            Traditional Medicare programs (6 percent), and Veterans Affairs (3 percent). Only 36 percent of Puerto Ricans
            received health insurance through a commercial insurance provider with premiums paid for by an employer or the
            consumer (Levis-Peralta et al. 2016). This contrasted starkly with insurance coverage on the US mainland, where
            most (59 percent) individuals receive employer-sponsored insurance or purchase their own insurance through a
            commercial insurance provider (Perreira et al. 2016).
